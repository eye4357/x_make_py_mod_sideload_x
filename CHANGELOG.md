# x_make_py_mod_sideload_x — Production Ledger

I log every notable change to this sideload protocol here. Entries follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and Semantic Versioning so covert imports remain fully accountable.

### Changed
- README and control notes updated for the Road to 0.20.4 campaign, highlighting how sideload manifests now feed the expanded Kanban evidence trail.

## [0.20.3] - 2025-10-14
### Changed
